So far I have just learned about using authenticate in relation to building web applications with Sinatra and how they work along side the gem bcypt. From my understanding it takes a string as an argument and checks to make sure that when building a login application the password matches up with the password digest. Some of the explaination for authenticate is a little confusing, but I get some some understanding with the examples in the labs. Essentially, when making a login process for a website you have to make sure that the user's password isn't easily accessed by hackers who like to steal the user's information. 
I look forward to building more websites that require logins and logout processes that can be built with Sinatra. The coding process seems to flesh out the ins and outs of making sure that specific information is hidden away without a developer knowing all of the details behind the security process. The fact that only using a few words to create a secret file within the code is very intriguing. I would like to get some more information behind the built-ins that come with bcypt and it's applity to hide information and also authenticate it with our developing databases for website servers.
