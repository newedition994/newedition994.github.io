I found Bootstrap Frameworks to be very interesting because it give more insight to the design aspect of web development and mobile web development. I kind of struggled with some of the CSS parts of the framework because I wanted to see design elements on the page, but sometimes my IDE didn't load all of the files so I would have to go back and redownload all of the files. All and all the section was interesting to learn because it was more of the basics of web development as oppose harder languages like Ruby and JavaScript, which I look forward to learning more about.
