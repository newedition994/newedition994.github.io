As a part of my assessment review for my rails assessment I was asked to create a new feature that made sense for my project that was about getting an appointment to have a person's picture taken. For a while I wasn't sure how to go about what I should make as a feature, but I ultimately decided to add link in the creating an appointment forum that shows the most popular package that was choosen by other users. It took a while for the feature to work because I couldn't quite remember how to write the scope that gets the right data. At first I was only getting all the packages that were create, but it was showing the most selected package. I had to go back to one of the labs that was about boat selection in relation to using SQL to find my desired data. I also had to remember that using the rails console was my friend and the best way to make sure that the scope function actually worked. I evenutually got it to work and display the most selected package, which made me very happy.
