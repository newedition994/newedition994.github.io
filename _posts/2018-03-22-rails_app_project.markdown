I am working on my first ruby on rails web app and I can honestly say I had no idea where to start. So instead of twiddling my fingers I started to look at past lab and write down some methods I wanted to use for my project, which led me to want to create a rails website to help people set up appointments to get their pictures taken. I have a general idea on how I would like things to look and work, but I need to get better at writing out the psuedo code then creating the method for the application. So far in the coding process my only weakness is having confidence in what I do know and looking up all of the steps for the programming I do not know.
I have decide to make web application that allows for clients to login with their google logins and set up an appointment to get their pictures taken by one photographer. I decided on the google login because more people have google logins for emails and not everyone uses social media to login or have github accounts.
