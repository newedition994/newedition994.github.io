For the Sinatra web application, I am really looking forward to building my own web application that involves a signup, login and logout code. It has been interesting learning about how the code looks when it interacts with HTML and Ruby, which come together to create a server that stores user data. I hope to create a web application that allows users to signup to sign in to give updates to other users about events in the area that are dedicated to a certain group of people. My hope is to get further along with this project quickly so I can start working on some real world web applications that have more information like JavaScript and CSS to make the website more appealing to look at other than just words on the screen. So for I have all of my folders and gemfile information to make sure that I have the MVC part of the project squared away to begin testing to pass y project. 

So far in this project I have been going through things a little quickly because of the amount of times we had to create links between files in databases for the previous labs before the final project. Now I am going through the testing phase of my work and I how to be complete by the end of the week. I am glad that this process is going smoothly and I hope that I finish as soon as possible. There have been a lot errors with the name for my web application because there was a problem with reading bgevent. Overall everything seems to working fine.
