       Well I decided to get more serious about learning how to code because I found that the career I went to college for wasn't my full passion. I enjoyed filming and editing videos as well as helping other express themselves creatively, but working with computers has always been my passion. Ever since I was a child I had always wanted to learn more about how computers worked and find better ways to understand the internet. I even took a web development class at my university, but there weren't enough class that catered to my interest so I stuck with media production. When I found Flatiron, I felt like I finally found a place to teach all the ins and outs of web development that didn't skim the surface of development, but actually dove deep into the different languages behind coding. I looked over the syllabus and decided Flatiron would be the place where I started my coding journey to learn something new everyday.
			 I hope that at the end of this program that I am able to get better at googling answers to any error message I may receive whether it be a code error or a system error. I think that learning code has definitely tested my patience in regards to when I want an answer, but I have come to learn sometimes the answer is simple and in your face or it's really difficult which means an answer will not come for a few days which is fine. Learning something new is not easy no matter what age you are, but dedicating more time to the learning process leads to more enjoyment out of the lessons once I finally pass a lab or get through a code-along.
