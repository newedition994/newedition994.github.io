Why did I start learning code? Well I decided to get more serious about learning how to code because I found that the career I went to college for wasn't my full passion. I enjoyed filming and editing videos as well as helping other express themselves creatively, but working with computers has always been my passion. Ever since I was a child I had always wanted to learn more about how computers worked and find better ways to understand the internet. I even took a web development class at my university, but there weren't enough class that catered to my interest so I stuck with media production. When I found Flatiron, I felt like I finally found a place to teach all the ins and outs of web development that didn't skim the surface of development, but actually dove deep into the different languages behind coding. I looked over the syllabus and decided Flatiron would be the place where I started my coding journey to learn something new everyday.
