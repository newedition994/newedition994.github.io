       This section was a little hard for me to understand and I still have a little trouble when writing code that involves self instance methods or calling self in general with ruby. To my understanding the keyword "self" allows an object to be aware of it's own behavior as well as what it is being asked to do in a method. "Self" refers to an instance or a method within classes used in ruby. Initially the idea seems simple enough, but things can get tricky if you don't understand what is going on in the entire class and how "self" gets tied into the entire code.
			 When the lessons are broken down to see all of the elements of class it can get confusing on how everything ties into one another. Some sections of the code in a lesson have nothing to do with the rest of the  example so you can easily get lost if you don't read the entire lesson to see that some bits are used in the lesson to show what not do or other ways to write a class using the "self" keyword. But in the I think i grasp the point of the self instance methods based on the dog class in the example. 
			 After reviewing the material a few times I have come to realize that as long as I remember to use the attribute accessor while defining my class I should be able to write each behavior I want an object to exhibit while in use. Also that if an object is called as an instance it can be called on within a method to get the same result as it does when it is a method on it's own.
